# RealTimeBusTracker
This was one of the harder projects for me. Creating APIS, learning how to link/ inbed the data of two locations and all the stops along the way. Making markers that moved from  bud stop to bus stop using real data. 
Something like this would be great for local tourist websites. Like a hop on hop of bus, giving real locations and attractions in the area. 
Anyone looking to make indepth travel websites or for universities to help their students find their way around town, this is a perfect project. 
A way to make a more in-depth version would to to add local stores/attractions as stops and the tracker can redirect to those locations.
